Many Data Center transports have been proposed in recent times. Contrary to the common perception that they are competitors. We claim that the underlying strategies used in these protocols are , in fact complementary.

So we design `PASE` a transport framework that synthesize existing transport strategies, namely, self-adjusting endpoints (used in TCP style protocols), in-network prioritization (used in pFabric), and arbitration(used in PDQ). PASE is deployment friendly It does not require any changes to the network fabric. Its performance is better than state-of-the-art protocols (pFabric). Using NS2 simulation and testbed experiments.

### Exising TCP CC Algorithm
* Summary of Congestion Control
* Reading date: 5/12/2018
* Keywords : TCP ; Congestion Control 

TCP Congestion Control aims at choose a strategy to find the appropriate cwnd and to acheive the best utility of bandwidth. In this summary, we briefly introduce several different mechanism in TCP CC Algorithm starting from TCP Vegas , TCP Reno , Cubic, BBR and Remy.

### Congestion Control Something to say
* Blog Conclusion of Congestion Control
* Reading date: 7/12/2018
* Keywords : Congestion Control ; Reinforcement Learning

I find a NYC coder's Blog in which it introduced several important concept in Congestion Control. Also with several useful code. So I read his 4 blogs and conclude his words. These 4 blogs are the introduction of CC, the Cubic , the RED , the Reinforcement Learning .
