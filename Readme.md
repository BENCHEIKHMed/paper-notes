Many Data Center transports have been proposed in recent times. Contrary to the common perception that they are competitors. We claim that the underlying strategies used in these protocols are , in fact complementary.

So we design `PASE` a transport framework that synthesize existing transport strategies, namely, self-adjusting endpoints (used in TCP style protocols), in-network prioritization (used in pFabric), and arbitration(used in PDQ). PASE is deployment friendly It does not require any changes to the network fabric. Its performance is better than state-of-the-art protocols (pFabric). Using NS2 simulation and testbed experiments.
