### Pensieve: Neural Adaptive Video Streaming with Pensieve â˜€

* Author: [Hongzi Mao](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hongzi/) (MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)

* Keywords : bitrate adaptation, video streaming, reinforcement learning
 
Client-side video players employ ABR algorithms to optimize user QoE. However, state-of-the-art ABR algorithms suffer from limitation: use fixed control rules based on simplified or inaccurate models of the deployment environment. We propose Pensieve, a system that generates ABR alggorithms using reinforcement learning (RL). Pensieve trains a neural network model hat selects bitrates for future video chunks based on observations collected by client video players. No matter that it outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme.

### PICC: Proactive Incast Congestion Control in a Datacenter Serving Web Application â˜€

* Author: Haoyu Wang (UVA University of Virginia)
* Index: Infocom 2018
* Reading date : 08/02/2019
* Keywords : Congestion Control, Web application
 
I read this paper because it is Infocom 2018 conference paper and it is about congestion control. But i have to say this paper's abstraction is not so good for reading.

With rapid development of web applications in datacenter, network latency becomes more important to user experience.The network latency will be greatly increased by incast congestion, in which a huge number of requests arrive at the front-end server simultaneously. This is an incast problem. Previous incast problem solutions are usually not efficient. In this paper, PICC (Proactive Incast Control System) is proposed. It limits the number of data servers concurrently connected to the front-end server to avoid the incast contestion through data placement.PICC incorporate a queuing delay reduction algorithm that assigns higher transmission priority to data objects with smaller size and longer queuing times.

### CCP:Restructuring Endpoint Congestion Control â˜€

* Author: Akshay Narayan (MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory)
* Index: Sigcomm 2018
* Reading date : 08/02/2019
* Keywords : Congestion Control, Operating System

This paper is very special idea contained. What it does is a unite thought. It describes the implementation and evaluation of a system to implement complex congestion control functions by placing them in a separate agent outside the datapath (which means Linux Kernel TCP, UDP-based QUIC, kernel-bypass transports like mTCP-on-DPDK) these datapath is for the information about packet rtt and ECN, losses. now we call this off-datapath system Congestion Control Plane(CCP). "write once, run anywhere" makes it supereasy.

### Jellyfish: Networking Data Centers Randomly

* Author: Ankit Singla (University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign)
* Index: HotCloud 2011
* Reading date : 31/01/2019
* Keywords : network topology

This paper is for the DataCenter Networking structure, because the datacenter needs high bandwidth requirement. So itself naturally to incremental expansion. Suprisingly, the Jellyfish is more cost-efficient than a fat-tree.
25% more servers at full capacity using the same equipment at the scale of a few thousand nodes, and this advantage improve with scale.
I learn what is HotCloud and the first sample reproducing.

### Pantheon: the training ground for Internet congestion-control research

* Author: Francis Y. Yanâ€ , (Stanford University)
* Index: Best Paper at USENIX ATC 2018
* Reading date : 27/01/2019
* Keywords : Congestion Control

The author present the [Pantheon](https://pantheon.stanford.edu), a system taht addresses this by serving as a community " training ground " for research on Internet Protocols and congestion control. There is a common set of benchmark algorithms and a shared evaluation platform, and a public archive of results.
Pantheon can also be used to develop new CC schemes , two of which already published on NSDI 2018. I think this is mysterious and interesting that's why i choose this paper to read.

### ECN or Delay: Lessons Learnt from Analysis of DCQCN and TIMELY

* Author: Yibo Zhu (Microsoft;ByteDance)
* Index: CoNEXT 2016 
* Reading date : 20/01/2019
* Keywords : Datacenter transport, RDMA, ECN, delay-based, congestion control

This is also for `[RDMA Section]` paper 2. Aiming at reviewing the classical paper in relative to RDMA. Based on the paper name, we already know that this paper is about the compare of `DCQCN` and `TIMELY`. 

According to the YiboZhu, which is the author of the `DCQCN`: DC networks especially drop-free RoCEv2 networks require efficient cc protocols. `DCQCN(ECN-based)` and `TIMELY(delay-based)` are two recent proposals for this purpose. In this paper, we analyze DCQCN and TIMELY using fluid models and simulations, for stability, convergence, fairness and flow completion time. We uncover several surprising behaviors of these protocols. 

The author also address the broader question: are there fundamental reasons to `prefer either ECN or delay` for end-to-end congestion control in DC Networks ?

### TIMELY: RTT-based Congestion Control for the DataCenter 

* Author: Radhika Mittal (UC Berkeley)
* Index: SIGCOMM 2015 
* Reading date : 20/01/2019
* Keywords : Datacenter transport, delay-based CC, OS-bypass, RDMA

This is for `[RDMA Section]` paper 2. Aiming at reviewing the classical paper in relative to RDMA. 

Datacenter transports aim to deliver low latency messageing together with high throughput. We show that simple packet delay, measured as `round-trip times` at hosts, is an effective congestion signal without the need for switch feedback. 

- First, we show that advances in NIC hardware have made RTT measurement possible with microsecond accuracy, and that these RTTs are sufficient to estimate switch queueing. 
- Then we describe how TIMELY can adjust transmission rates using RTT gradients to keep packet latency low while delivering high bandwidth. 

TIMELY is the first delay-based CC protocol in datacenter. And it achieves its result despite having an order of magnitude fewer RTT signals.

This paper is finished by my Academic Idol Lisa Yan. This paper is so important because [Hope](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs244/index.html) is a waking [dream](https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com/page/2/)ï¼Ž

    I'd like to deal with this course as a student.
    I'd like to do the final pj of this course.

Lisa Yan said that:
> "In the past five years, the graduate networking course at Stanford has assigned over 200 students the task of reproducing results from over 40 networking papers. We began the project as a means of teaching both engineering rigor and critical thinking, qualities that are necessary for careers in networking research and industry. We have observed that reproducing research can simultaneously be a tool for education and a means for students to contribute to the networking community. "

### Stream-based ML for Network Security and Anomaly Detection
* Author: Pavol Mulinka (CTU Czech)
* Index: SIGCOMM 2018 Workshop
* Reading date : 15/01/2019
* Keywords : Machine Learning; Computing methodologies; Security and Privacy.

This paper is about `Data Stream Machine Learning` for `network security and anomaly detection`. And especially for `on-line` questions (in this field the general approach is still off-line learning problem). The experiment result shows that the `adaptive random forests and stochastic gradient descent` models are able to keep up with important `concept drifts` by keeping high accuracy. 

They also introduced Big-DAMA, a big data analytics framework for large scale network traffic monitoring and analysis.

### Friends, not Foes - Synthesizing Existing Trnasport Strategies for Data Center Networks
* Author: Ali Munir (Michigan State University)
* Index: SIGCOMM 2014
* Reading date : 3/12/2018
* Keywords : Datacenter transport; Congestion Control 

Many Data Center transports have been proposed in recent times. Contrary to the common perception that they are competitors. We claim that the underlying strategies used in these protocols are , in fact complementary.

So we design `PASE` a transport framework that synthesize existing transport strategies, namely, self-adjusting endpoints (used in TCP style protocols), in-network prioritization (used in pFabric), and arbitration(used in PDQ). PASE is deployment friendly It does not require any changes to the network fabric. Its performance is better than state-of-the-art protocols (pFabric). Using NS2 simulation and testbed experiments.
